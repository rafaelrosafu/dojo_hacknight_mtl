# Roman Numerals - Coding Dojo Ruby Hacknight December 2013

This puzzle was taken from [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz22.html).

## Install

You must have Ruby (1.9.3+ recommended) and the bundler gem pre-installed, after that:

```
git clone git@github.com:rafaelrosafu/dojo_hacknight_mtl.git
cd dojo_hacknight_mtl
bundle install --path=vendor --binstubs
bin/rspec
```

This will download the repo, install dependencies in a local directory without contaminating your global gem repo and run the tests, they should be all green.
